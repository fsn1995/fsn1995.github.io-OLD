### Projects
1. [Drought analysis with Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/fsn1995/Drought-Analysis) (Compare SPEI with NDVI anomalies) 
- Poster at EGU General Assembly 2019:
Investigating vegetation response to meteorological drought. This is done by correlating SPEI with NDVI anomalies. [EGU2019-19137](https://github.com/fsn1995/Drought-Analysis/blob/master/doc/EGU2019-19137_Drought%20Analysis.pdf) 
- Currently working on global scale study (hope it will be published)

2. Glacier surge study using Landsat imagery
- Poster at EGU General Assembly 2019:  
Surge Type Glacier Identification on Northeast Spitsbergen, Svalbard from Landsat Imagery 1984-2018 [EGU2019-135](https://github.com/fsn1995/fsn1995.github.io/blob/master/doc/Conference/EGU2019-135_Glacier%20Surge_Shunan.pdf)
- Identifying surge type glacier from reconstructed glacier surface velocity.

### Learning
1. [GeoResource Collection](https://fsn1995.github.io/GeoResource-Collection/)
- A personal collection of the dataset/tools that I find useful in my study. This list will be frequently updated.
2. [Google Earth Engine practice and tools (fun with GEE)](https://github.com/fsn1995/Fun-with-Google-Earth-Engine)
3. [Google Earth Engine self-training](https://github.com/fsn1995/Goolgle-Earth-Engine-self-training)
4. [Matlab practice and tools](https://github.com/fsn1995/MatlabFSN)
5. [Python practice and tools](https://github.com/fsn1995/PythonFSN)
6. Currently interested in learning machine learning and TensorFlow.
7. Searching for PhD position now, interested in RS and glaciers, snow and droughts.
