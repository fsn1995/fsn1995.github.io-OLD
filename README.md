- Poster at EGU General Assembly 2019:
Investigating vegetation response to meteorological drought. This is done by correlating SPEI with NDVI anomalies. [EGU2019-19137](https://github.com/fsn1995/Drought-Analysis/blob/master/doc/EGU2019-19137_Drought%20Analysis.pdf) 
- Currently working on global scale study (hope it will be published)

2. Glacier surge study using Landsat imagery
