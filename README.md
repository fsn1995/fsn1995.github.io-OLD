## Projects
### 1. [Drought analysis with Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/fsn1995/Drought-Analysis) (Compare SPEI with NDVI anomalies) 
- Poster at EGU General Assembly 2019 [EGU2019-19137](https://github.com/fsn1995/Drought-Analysis/blob/master/doc/EGU2019-19137_Drought%20Analysis.pdf)

### To be continued...
The best thing about earth science to me is the combination of geospatial data visualization and fieldwork. I am interested in understanding the process and climate response of earth surface, particularly time series analysis by combining the in-situ measurement, remote sensing or other geospatial data and model results. This had led me to specialize in remote sensing, geospatial data analysis and modelling during my study. I'm a self motivated learner. My experience with satellite image processing, spatial statistics, data analysis and visulization enables me to learn and practice skills with **MATLAB**, ENVI/IDL, **Google Earth Engine**, **Python** and ArcGIS etc. 

Currently interested in learning machine learning and TensorFlow. Searching for remote sensing and cryosphere related vacancy.
